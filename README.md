# NLP Arsenal

This repository contains small projects related to NLP. These projects were done with the aim to learn different applications of NLP and get comfortable with various tools and techniques.

- [Topic Modelling using LDA](https://github.com/arya46/NLP-Arsenal/tree/main/Topic%20Modelling%20using%20LDA): This project is a hands-on practise on how to split a collection of documents into topics using Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA).

  **Blog on LDA**: [TODO]()
  
- [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/arya46/NLP-Arsenal/tree/main/Neural%20Sentiment%20Analysis): This project is about using several machine learning classifiers, including Recurrent Neural Networks, to predict the sentiments in text.

- [Machine Translation](https://github.com/arya46/NLP-Arsenal/tree/main/Neural%20Machine%Translation): This project is about using Neural Networks to perform the task of Machine Translation using a Seq2Seq model.
